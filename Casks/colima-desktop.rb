  caveats <<~EOS
    Colima Desktop drives the `colima` CLI and needs it (plus `docker`) on your PATH;
    both are installed automatically as dependencies of this cask.

    For the Kubernetes view, also install kubectl:
      brew install kubectl

    For the Docker Compose view, `docker-compose` is installed automatically as a
    dependency of this cask and used as a CLI plugin (`docker compose ...`), not the
    standalone `docker-compose` command. If `docker compose version` doesn't find it,
    point Docker at Homebrew's plugin directory by adding to your docker config
    (usually ~/.docker/config.json):
      "cliPluginsExtraDirs": ["/opt/homebrew/lib/docker/cli-plugins"]
    See `brew info docker-compose` for details.
